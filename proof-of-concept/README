This is a proof of concert implementation for a server side only highchart rendering engine using rhino, envjs, jquery and batik.


Hacks/Patches/Modificaton:

the modified

- modified hasSVG in highcharts.src.js, is Envjs aware now
- provided dummy function for missing getBBox. 
- modified getSVG in exporting.src.js, innerHTML was undefined in the container
- modified buildText in highcharts.src.js, as getComputedStyle seems to return undefined (around line 2304)


Issues:

- all of the above changes do prevent upgrading of highcharts
- the fake getBBox doesnt work with well with arbitrary charts
- The y Axis tick labels do overlap the axis label and legel (see options3.png)
